<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ISTORY and mythology, fact and fable,
are closely interwoven in the texture of
Japanese life and thought; indeed, it is
within relatively recent years only that
exact comparative criticism has been able,
with some degree of accuracy, to divide the
one from the other. The accounts of the
God-period contained in the Kojiki and
the Nihongi&mdash;&ldquo;Records of Ancient Matters&rdquo;
compiled in the eighth century of the
Christian era&mdash;profess to outline the events
of the vast cycles of years from the time
of Ame-no-mi-naka-nushi-no-kami&rsquo;s birth in
the Plain of High Heaven, &ldquo;when the
earth, young and like unto floating oil,
drifted about medusa-like,&rdquo; to the death of
the Empress Suiko, <small>A.D.</small> 628.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
The first six tales in this little volume
are founded on some of the most significant
and picturesque incidents of this God-period.
The opening legend gives a brief relation
of the birth of several of the great Shinto
deities, of the creation of Japan and of the
world, of the Orpheus-like descent of Izanagi
to Hades, and of his subsequent fight with the
demons.</p>

<p>That Chinese civilisation has exercised a
profound influence on that of Japan, cannot
be doubted. A scholar of repute has indicated
that evidence of this is to be found even
in writings so early as the Kojiki and the
Nihongi. To give a single instance only:
the curved jewels, of which the remarkable
necklace of Ama-terasu was made, have never
been found in Japan, whereas the stones are
not uncommon in China.</p>

<p>This is not the place critically to consider
the wealth of myth, legend, fable, and
folk-tale to be found scattered throughout
Japanese literature, and represented
in Japanese art: suffice it to say, that
to the student and the lover of primitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vii]</a></span>
romance, there are here vast fields practically
unexplored.</p>

<p>The tales contained in this volume have
been selected with a view rather to their
beauty and charm of incident and colour,
than with the aim to represent adequately
the many-sided subject of Japanese lore.
Moreover, those only have been chosen
which are not familiar to the English-reading
public. Several of the classic names
of Japan have been interpolated in the text.
It remains to say that, in order not to
weary the reader, it has been found necessary
to abbreviate the many-syllabled Japanese
names.</p>

<p>The sources from which I have drawn
are too numerous to particularise. To Professor
Basil Hall Chamberlain, whose intimate
and scholarly knowledge of all matters
Japanese is well known, my thanks are
especially due, as also the expression of my
indebtedness to other writers in English,
from Mr. A.&nbsp;B. Mitford to Mr. Lafcadio
Hearn, whose volumes on &ldquo;Unfamiliar Japan&rdquo;
appeared last year. The careful text of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
Dr. David Brauns, and the studies of F.&nbsp;A.
Junker von Langegg, have also been
of great service. The works of numerous
French writers on Japanese art have likewise
been consulted with advantage.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE time
was, and while
yet the world was uncreated,
chaos reigned.
The earth and the waters,
the light and the darkness, the stars and
the firmament, were intermingled in a vapoury
liquid. All things were formless and confused.
No creature existed; phantom shapes moved
as clouds on the ruffled surface of a sea. It
was the birth-time of the gods. The first
deity sprang from an immense bulrush-bud,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
which rose, spear-like, in the midst of the
boundless disorder. Other gods were born,
but three generations passed before the actual
separation of the atmosphere from the more
solid earth. Finally, where the tip of the
bulrush points upward, the Heavenly Spirits
appeared.</p>

<p>From this time their kingdom was divided
from the lower world where chaos still prevailed.
To the fourth pair of gods it was given to
create the earth. These two beings were the
powerful God of the Air, Izanagi, and the fair
Goddess of the Clouds, Izanami. From them
sprang all life.</p>

<p>Now Izanagi and Izanami wandered on the
Floating Bridge of Heaven. This bridge
spanned the gulf between heaven and the unformed
world; it was upheld in the air, and
it stood secure. The God of the Air spoke
to the Goddess of the Clouds: &ldquo;There must
needs be a kingdom beneath us, let us visit
it.&rdquo; When he had so said, he plunged his
jewelled spear into the seething mass below.
The drops that fell from the point of the
spear congealed and became the island of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
Onogoro. Thereupon the Earth-Makers descended,
and called up a high mountain peak,
on whose summit could rest one end of the
Heavenly Bridge, and around which the whole
world should revolve.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">
<a name="owj02" id="owj02"></a>
<img src="images/owj02.jpg" width="369" height="600"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">When he had so said, he plunged his jewelled spear into the seething
mass below.</p>
</div>

<p>The Wisdom of the Heavenly Spirit had
decreed that Izanagi should be a man, and Izanami
a woman, and these two deities decided to
wed and dwell together on the earth. But, as
befitted their august birth, the wooing must
be solemn. Izanagi skirted the base of the
mountain to the right, Izanami turned to the
left. When the Goddess of the Clouds saw
the God of the Air approaching afar off, she
cried, enraptured: &ldquo;Ah, what a fair and
lovely youth!&rdquo; Then Izanagi exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah,
what a fair and lovely maiden!&rdquo; As they met,
they clasped hands, and the marriage was accomplished.
But, for some unknown cause, the
union did not prove as happy as the god and
goddess had hoped. They continued their work
of creation, but Awaji, the island that rose
from the deep, was little more than a barren
waste, and their first-born son, Hiruko, was a
weakling. The Earth-Makers placed him in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
a little boat woven of reeds, and left him
to the mercy of wind and tide.</p>

<p>In deep grief, Izanagi and Izanami recrossed
the Floating Bridge, and came to the place
where the Heavenly Spirits hold eternal audience.
From them they learned that Izanagi
should have been the first to speak, when
the gods met round the base of the Pillar of
Earth. They must woo and wed anew. On
their return to earth, Izanagi, as before, went
to the right, and Izanami to the left of the
mountain, but now, when they met, Izanagi
exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah, what a fair and lovely
maiden!&rdquo; and Izanami joyfully responded,
&ldquo;Ah, what a fair and lovely youth!&rdquo; They
clasped hands once more, and their happiness
began. They created the eight large
islands of the Kingdom of Japan; first the
luxuriant Island of the Dragon-fly, the great
Yamato; then Tsukushi, the White-Sun Youth;
Iyo, the Lovely Princess, and many more.
The rocky islets of the archipelago were
formed by the foam of the rolling breakers
as they dashed on the coast-lines of the
islands already created. Thus China and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
remaining lands and continents of the world
came into existence.</p>

<p>Now were born to Izanagi and Izanami,
the Ruler of the Rivers, the Deity of the
Mountains, and, later, the God of the Trees,
and a goddess to whom was entrusted the
care of tender plants and herbs.</p>

<p>Then Izanagi and Izanami said: &ldquo;We have
created the mighty Kingdom of the Eight
Islands, with mountains, rivers, and trees; yet
another divinity there must be, who shall
guard and rule this fair world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they spoke, a daughter was born to
them. Her beauty was dazzling, and her regal
bearing betokened that her throne should be
set high above the clouds. She was none
other than Ama-terasu, The Heaven-Illuminating
Spirit. Izanagi and Izanami rejoiced
greatly when they beheld her face, and
exclaimed, &ldquo;Our daughter shall dwell in
the Blue Plain of High Heaven, and from
there she shall direct the universe.&rdquo; So
they led her to the summit of the mountain,
and over the wondrous bridge. The
Heavenly Spirits were joyful when they saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
Ama-terasu, and said: &ldquo;You shall mount
into the soft blue of the sky, your brilliancy
shall illumine, and your sweet smile shall
gladden, the Eternal Land, and all the world.
Fleecy clouds shall be your handmaidens,
and sparkling dewdrops your messengers of
peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next child of Izanagi and Izanami
was a son, and as he also was beautiful, with
the dream-like beauty of the evening, they
placed him in the heavens, as co-ruler with
his sister Ama-terasu. His name was Tsuku-yomi,
the Moon-God. The god Susa-no-o is
another son of the two deities who wooed
and wed around the base of the Pillar of
Earth. Unlike his brother and his sister,
he was fond of the shadow and the gloom.
When he wept, the grass on the mountainside
withered, the flowers were blighted,
and men died. Izanagi had little joy in
this son, nevertheless he made him ruler of
the ocean.</p>

<p>Now that the world was created, the happy
life of the God of the Air and the Goddess
of the Clouds was over. The consumer, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
God of Fire, was born, and Izanami died.
She vanished into the deep solitudes of the
Kingdom of the Trees, in the country of
Kii, and disappeared thence into the lower
regions.</p>

<p>Izanagi was sorely troubled because Izanami
had been taken from him, and he descended
in pursuit of her to the portals of the shadowy
kingdom where sunshine is unknown. Izanami
would fain have left that place to rejoin
Izanagi on the beautiful earth. Her spirit
came to meet him, and in urgent and tender
words besought him not to seek her in those
cavernous regions. But the bold god would
not be warned. He pressed forward, and,
by the light struck from his comb, he sought
for his loved one long and earnestly. Grim
forms rose to confront him, but he passed
them by with kingly disdain. Sounds as of
the wailing of lost souls struck his ear, but still
he persisted. After endless search, he found
his Izanami lying in an attitude of untold
despair, but so changed was she, that he gazed
intently into her eyes ere he could recognise
her. Izanami was angry that Izanagi had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
listened to her commands, for she knew how
fruitless would be his efforts. Without the
sanction of the ruler of the under-world, she
could not return to earth, and this consent
she had tried in vain to obtain.</p>

<p>Izanagi, hard pressed by the eight monsters
who guard the Land of Gloom, had to flee
for his life. He defended himself valiantly with
his sword; then he threw down his head-dress,
and it was transformed into bunches of
purple grapes; he also cast behind him the
comb, by means of which he had obtained
light, and from it sprang tender shoots of bamboo.
While the monsters eagerly devoured
the luscious grapes and tender shoots, Izanagi
gained the broad flight of steps which led
back to earth. At the top he paused and
cried to Izanami: &ldquo;All hope of our reunion
is now at an end. Our separation must be
eternal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stretching far beyond Izanagi lay the ocean,
and on its surface was reflected the face of
his well-beloved daughter, Ama-terasu. She
seemed to speak, and beseech him to purify
himself in the great waters of the sea. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
he bathed, his wounds were healed, and a
sense of infinite peace stole over him.</p>

<p>The life-work of the Earth-Maker was
done. He bestowed the world upon his
children, and afterwards crossed, for the last
time, the many-coloured Bridge of Heaven.
The God of the Air now spends his days
with the Heaven-Illuminating Spirit in her
sun-glorious palace.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>MA-TERASU, the Sun-Goddess, was
seated in the Blue Plain of Heaven.
Her light came as a message of joy to the
celestial deities. The orchid and the iris, the
cherry and the plum blossom, the rice and
the hemp fields answered to her smile. The
Inland Sea was veiled in soft rich colour.</p>

<p>Susa-no-o, the brother of Ama-terasu, who
had resigned his ocean sceptre and now
reigned as the Moon-God, was jealous of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
his sister&rsquo;s glory and world-wide sway. The
Heaven-Illuminating Spirit had but to whisper
and she was heard throughout her kingdom,
even in the depths of the clear pool and in
the heart of the crystal. Her rice-fields,
whether situated on hill-side, in sheltered
valley, or by running stream, yielded abundant
harvests, and her groves were laden
with fruit. But the voice of Susa-no-o was
not so clear, his smile was not so radiant.
The undulating fields which lay around his
palace were now flooded, now parched, and
his rice crops were often destroyed. The
wrath and jealousy of the Moon-God knew no
bounds, yet Ama-terasu was infinitely patient
and forgave him many things.</p>

<p>Once, as was her wont, the Sun-Goddess
sat in the central court of her glorious home.
She plied her shuttle. Celestial weaving
maidens surrounded a fountain whose waters
were fragrant with the heavenly lotus-bloom:
they sang softly of the clouds and the wind
and the lift of the sky. Suddenly, the body
of a piebald horse fell through the vast dome
at their feet: the &ldquo;Beloved of the Gods&rdquo; had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
been &ldquo;flayed with a backward flaying&rdquo; by the
envious Susa-no-o. Ama-terasu, trembling
at the horrible sight, pricked her finger with
the weaving shuttle, and, profoundly indignant
at the cruelty of her brother, withdrew
into a cave and closed behind her the door
of the Heavenly Rock Dwelling.</p>

<p>The universe was plunged in darkness.
Joy and goodwill, serenity and peace, hope
and love, waned with the waning light.
Evil spirits, who heretofore had crouched in
dim corners, came forth and roamed abroad.
Their grim laughter and discordant tones
struck terror into all hearts.</p>

<p>Then it was that the gods, fearful for their
safety and for the life of every beautiful
thing, assembled in the bed of the tranquil
River of Heaven, whose waters had been
dried up. One and all knew that Ama-terasu
alone could help them. But how allure the
Heaven-Illuminating Spirit to set foot in this
world of darkness and strife? Each god was
eager to aid, and a plan was finally devised
to entice her from her hiding-place.</p>

<p>Ame-no-ko uprooted the holy <i>sakaki</i> trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
which grow on the Mountain of Heaven,
and planted them around the entrance of the
cave. High on the upper branches were
hung the precious string of curved jewels
which Izanagi had bestowed upon the Sun-Goddess.
From the middle branches drooped
a mirror wrought of the rare metals of the
celestial mine. Its polished surface was as
the dazzling brilliancy of the sun. Other
gods wove, from threads of hemp and paper
mulberry, an imperial robe of white and blue,
which was placed, as an offering for the
goddess, on the lower branches of the <i>sakaki</i>.
A palace was also built, surrounded by a
garden in which the Blossom-God called forth
many delicate plants and flowers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">

<p class="caption">Ama-terasu gazed into the mirror, and wondered greatly when she
saw therein a goddess of exceeding beauty.</p>
</div>

<p>Now all was ready. Ame-no-ko stepped
forward, and, in a loud voice, entreated
Ama-terasu to show herself. His appeal
was in vain. The great festival began.
Uzume, the goddess of mirth, led the dance
and song. Leaves of the spindle tree crowned
her head; club-moss, from the heavenly mount
Kagu, formed her sash; her flowing sleeves
were bound with the creeper-vine; and in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
hand she carried leaves of the wild bamboo
and waved a wand of sun-grass hung with
tiny melodious bells. Uzume blew on a
bamboo flute, while the eight hundred myriad
deities accompanied her on wooden clappers
and instruments formed of bow-strings, across
which were rapidly drawn stalks of reed and
grass. Great fires were lighted around the
cave, and, as these were reflected in the
face of the mirror, &ldquo;the long-singing birds
of eternal night&rdquo; began to crow as if the
day dawned. The merriment increased. The
dance grew wilder and wilder, and the gods
laughed until the heavens shook as if with
thunder.</p>

<p>Ama-terasu, in her quiet retreat, heard,
unmoved, the crowing of the cocks and the
sounds of music and dancing, but when the
heavens shook with the laughter of the gods,
she peeped from her cave and said: &ldquo;What
means this? I thought heaven and earth
were dark, but now there is light. Uzume
dances and all the gods laugh.&rdquo; Uzume
answered: &ldquo;It is true that I dance and that
the gods laugh, because in our midst is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
goddess whose splendour equals your own.
Behold!&rdquo; Ama-terasu gazed into the mirror,
and wondered greatly when she saw therein
a goddess of exceeding beauty. She stepped
from her cave and forthwith a cord of
rice-straw was drawn across the entrance.
Darkness fled from the Central Land of
Reed-Plains, and there was light. Then the
eight hundred myriad deities cried: &ldquo;O, may
the Sun-Goddess never leave us again.&rdquo;</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE gods looked down from the Plain of
High Heaven and saw that wicked earth-spirits
peopled the lower world. Neither by
day nor by night was there peace. Oshi-homi,
whose name is His Augustness Heavenly-Great-Great-Ears,
was commanded to go
down and govern the earth. As he set foot
on the Floating Bridge, he heard the sounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
of strife and confusion, so he returned, and
said, &ldquo;I would have you choose another deity
to do this work.&rdquo; Then the Great Heavenly
Spirit and Ama-terasu called together the
eight hundred myriad deities in the bed of
the Tranquil River of Heaven. The Sun-Goddess
spoke: &ldquo;In the Central Land of
Reed-Plains there is trouble and disorder.
A deity must descend to prepare the earth
for our grandson Prince Ruddy-Plenty, who
is to rule over it. Whom shall we send?&rdquo;
The eight hundred myriad deities replied,
&ldquo;Let Ame-no-ho go to the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Ame-no-ho descended to the lower
world. There he was so happy that the
charge of the heavenly deities passed out of
his mind. He lived with the earth-spirits,
and confusion still reigned.</p>

<p class="caption">As the Young Prince alighted on the sea-shore, a beautiful earth-spirit,
Princess Under-Shining, stood before him.</p>
</div>

<p>For three years the Great Heavenly Spirit
and Ama-terasu waited for tidings, but none
came. Then they said: &ldquo;We will send Ame-waka,
the Heavenly Young Prince. He will
surely do our bidding.&rdquo; Into his hands they
gave the great heavenly deer-bow and the
heavenly feathered arrows which fly straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
to the mark. &ldquo;With these you shall war
against the wicked earth-spirits, and bring
order into the land.&rdquo; But as the Young
Prince alighted on the sea-shore, a beautiful
earth-spirit, Princess Under-Shining, stood
before him. Her loveliness bewitched him.
He looked upon her, and could not withdraw
his eyes. Soon they were wedded. Eight
years passed. The Young Prince spent the
time in revelry and feasting. Not once did
he attempt to establish peace and order;
moreover, he desired to place himself at the
head of the earth-spirits, to defy the heavenly
deities, and to rule over the Land of Reed-Plains.</p>

<p>Again the eight hundred myriad deities
assembled in the bed of the Tranquil River
of Heaven. The Sun-Goddess spoke: &ldquo;Our
messenger has tarried in the lower world.
Whom shall we send to inquire the cause
of this?&rdquo; Then the gods commanded a faithful
pheasant hen: &ldquo;Go to Ame-waka, and
say, &lsquo;The Heavenly Deities sent you to the
Central Land of Reed-Plains to subdue and
pacify the deities of that land. For eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
years you have been silent. What is the
cause?&rsquo;&rdquo; The pheasant flew swiftly to earth,
and perched on the branches of a wide-spreading
cassia tree which stood at the gate
of the Prince&rsquo;s palace. She spoke every
word of her message, but no reply came.
Again she repeated the words of the gods,
again there was no answer. Now Ama-no-sagu,
the Heavenly Spying-Woman, heard
the call of the pheasant; she went to the
Young Prince, and said, &ldquo;The cry of this
bird bodes ill. Take thy bow and arrows
and kill it.&rdquo; Then Ame-waka, in wrath, shot
the bird through the heart.</p>

<p>The heavenly arrow fled upward and onward.
Swift as the wind it sped through
the air, it pierced the clouds and fell at the
feet of the Sun-Goddess as she sat on her
throne.</p>

<p>Ama-terasu saw that it was one of the
arrows that had been entrusted to the Young
Prince, and that the feathers were stained
with blood. Then she took the arrow in
her hands and sent it forth: &ldquo;If this be an
arrow shot by our messenger at the evil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
spirits, let it not hit the Heavenly Prince. If
he has a foul heart, let him perish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment Ame-waka was resting after
the harvest feast. The arrow flew straight to
its mark, and pierced him to the heart as he
slept. Princess Under-Shining cried aloud
when she saw the dead body of the Young
Prince. Her cries rose to the heavens. Then
the father of Ame-waka raised a mighty storm,
and the wind carried the body of the Young
Prince to the Blue Plain. A great mourning-house
was built, and for eight days and eight
nights there was wailing and lamentation.
The wild goose of the river, the heron, the
kingfisher, the sparrow and the pheasant
mourned with a great mourning.</p>

<p>When Aji-shi-ki came to weep for his
brother, his face was so like that of the Young
Prince that his parents fell upon him, and said:
&ldquo;My child is not dead, no! My lord is not
dead, no!&rdquo; But Aji-shi-ki was wroth because
they had taken him for his dead brother. He
drew his ten-grasp sabre and cut down the
mourning-house, and scattered the fragments
to the winds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
Then the heavenly deities said: &ldquo;Take-Mika
shall go down and subdue this unruly
land.&rdquo; In company with Tori-bune he set
forth and came to the shore of Inasa, in the
country of Idzumo. They drew their swords
and placed them on a crest of the waves.
On the points of the swords Take-Mika and
Tori-bune sat, cross-legged: thus they made
war against the earth-spirits, and thus subdued
them. The land once pacified, their mission
was accomplished, and they returned to the
Plain of High Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>MA-TERASU,
from her sun-glorious
palace, spoke to her grandson,
Ninigi, Prince Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty: &ldquo;You
must descend from your Heavenly Rock Seat
and go to rule the luxuriant Land-of-Fresh-Rice-Ears.&rdquo;
She gave him many presents;
precious stones from the mountain steps of
heaven, crystal balls of purest whiteness, and
the cloud-sword which her brother, Susa-no-o,
had drawn from the tail of the terrible dragon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
She also entrusted to Ninigi the mirror whose
splendour had enticed her from the cave, and
said: &ldquo;Guard this mirror faithfully; when
you look into it you shall see my face.&rdquo;
A number of deities were commanded to accompany
Prince Ruddy-Plenty, among them
the beautiful Uzume, who had danced till
the heavens shook with the laughter of the
gods.</p>

<p>The great company broke through the
clouds. Before them, at the eight-forked road
of Heaven, stood a deity of gigantic stature,
with his large and fiery eyes. The courage
of the gods failed at sight of him, and they
turned backward. But the fair Uzume went
fearlessly up to the giant, and said: &ldquo;Who is it
that thus impedes our descent from heaven?&rdquo;
The deity, well pleased at the gracious mien
of the goddess, made answer: &ldquo;I am a friendly
earth-spirit, the Deity of the Field-Paths. I
come to meet Ninigi that I may pay homage
to him and be his guide. Return and say to
the august god that the Prince of Saruta
greets him. I am this Prince, O Uzume.&rdquo;
The Goddess of Mirth rejoiced greatly when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
she heard these words, and said: &ldquo;The company
of gods shall proceed to earth; there
will Ninigi be made known to you.&rdquo; Then
the Deity of the Field-Paths spoke: &ldquo;Let
the army of gods alight on the mountain of
Takachihi, in the country of Tsukushi. On
its peak I shall await them.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
<a name="owj08" id="owj08"></a>
<img src="images/owj08.jpg" width="372" height="600"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">But the fair Uzume went fearlessly up to the giant, and said: &ldquo;Who
is it that thus impedes our descent from heaven?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Uzume returned to the gods and delivered
the message. When Prince Ruddy-Plenty
heard her words he again broke through
the eightfold spreading cloud, and floated on
the Bridge of Heaven to the summit of
Takachihi.</p>

<p>Now Ninigi, with the Prince of Saruta as
his guide, travelled throughout the kingdom
over which he was to rule. He saw the
mountain ranges and the lakes, the great
reed plains and the vast pine forests, the
rivers and the valleys. Then he said: &ldquo;It
is a land whereon the morning sun shines
straight, a land which the evening sun illumines.
So this place is an exceeding good
place.&rdquo; When he had thus spoken, he built
a palace. The pillars rested on the nethermost
rock-bottom, and the cross-beams rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
to the Plain of High Heaven. In this palace
he dwelt.</p>

<p>Again Ninigi spoke: &ldquo;The God of the
Field-Paths shall return to his home. He
has been our guide, therefore he shall wed
the beautiful goddess, Uzume, and she shall
be priestess in his own mountain.&rdquo; Uzume
obeyed the commands of Ninigi, and is greatly
honoured in Saruta for her courage, her mirth,
and her beauty.</p>

<p>It happened that as the Son of the Gods
walked along the sea-coast, he saw a maiden
of exceeding loveliness. He spoke to her,
and said: &ldquo;By what name are you known?&rdquo;
She replied: &ldquo;I am the daughter of the Deity
Great-Mountain-Possessor, and my name is
Ko-no-hane, Princess Tree-Blossom.&rdquo; Ninigi
loved the fair Princess. He went to the Spirit
of the Mountains, and asked for her hand.
But Oho-yama had an elder daughter, Iha-naga,
Princess Long-as-the-Rocks, who was
less fair than her sister. He desired that
the offspring of Prince Ruddy-Plenty should
live eternally like unto the rocks, and flourish
as the blossom of the trees. Therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
Oho-yama sent both his daughters to Ninigi
in rich attire and with many rare presents.
Ninigi loved the beautiful Princess Ko-no-hane.
He would not look upon Iha-naga.
She cried out in wrath: &ldquo;Had you chosen
me, you and your children would have lived
long on earth; but as you love my sister all
your descendants will perish rapidly as the
blossom of the trees.&rdquo; Thus it is that human
life is so short compared with that of the
earlier peoples that were gods.</p>

<p>For some time, Ninigi dwelt happily with
Princess Tree-Blossom: then a cloud came
over their lives. Ko-no-hane had the delicate
grace, the morning freshness, the subtle charm
of the cherry blossom. She loved the sunshine
and the soft west wind. She loved the
cool rain, and the quiet summer night. But
Ninigi grew jealous. In anger Princess Tree-Blossom
retired to her palace, closed up the
entrance, and set it on fire. The flames
rose higher and higher. Ninigi watched
anxiously. As he looked, three little boys
sprang merrily out of the flames and called
for their father. Prince Ruddy-Plenty was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
glad once more, and when he saw Ko-no-hane,
unharmed, move towards him, he asked
her forgiveness. They named their sons Ho-deri,
Fire-Flash; Ho-suseri, Fire-Climax; and
Ho-wori, Fire-Fade.</p>

<p>After many years, Ninigi divided his kingdom
between two of his sons. Then Prince
Ruddy-Plenty returned to the Plain of High
Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>O-WORI, Prince
Fire-Fade, the
son of Ninigi, was a
great hunter. He caught
&lsquo;things rough of hair and
things soft of hair.&rsquo; His elder

was a fisher who caught &lsquo;things broad
of fin and things narrow of fin.&rsquo; But, often,

Ho-deri had to stay at home, while at nightfall

the mountains. Ho-deri spoke to his brother,
and said: &ldquo;I would have your bow and arrows
and become a hunter. You shall have my fish-hook.&rdquo;
At first Ho-wori would not consent,
but finally the exchange was made.</p>

<p>Now Prince Fire-Flash was no hunter.
He could not track the game, nor run swiftly,
nor take good aim. Day after day Prince
Fire-Fade went out to sea. In vain he threw
his line; he caught no fish. Moreover, one
day, he lost his brother&rsquo;s fish-hook. Then
Ho-deri came to Ho-wori, and said: &ldquo;There
is the luck of the mountain and there is the
luck of the sea. Let each restore to the other
his luck.&rdquo; Ho-wori replied: &ldquo;I did not catch
a single fish with your hook, and now it is
lost in the sea.&rdquo; The elder brother was very
angry, and, with many hard words, demanded
the return of his treasure. Prince Fire-Fade
was unhappy. He broke in pieces his good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
sword and made five hundred fish-hooks which
he offered to his brother. But this did not
appease the wrath of Prince Fire-Flash, who
still raged and asked for his own hook.</p>

<p>Ho-wori could find neither comfort nor help.
He sat one day by the shore and heaved a
deep sigh. The old Man of the Sea heard
the sigh, and asked the cause of his sorrow.
Ho-wori told him of the loss of the fish-hook,
and of his brother&rsquo;s displeasure. Thereupon
the wise man promised to give his help. He
plaited strips of bamboo so tightly together
that the water could not pass through, and
fashioned therewith a stout little boat. Into
this boat Ho-wori jumped, and was carried
far out to sea.</p>

<p>After a time, as the old man had foretold,
his boat began to sink. Deeper and deeper
it sank, until at last he came to a glittering
palace of fishes&rsquo; scales. In front of it was a
well, shaded by a great cassia tree. Prince
Fire-Fade sat among the wide-spreading
branches. He looked down, and saw a maiden
approach the well; in her hand she carried
a jewelled bowl. She was the lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
Toyo-tama, Peerless Jewel, the daughter of
Wata-tsu-mi, the Sea-King. Ho-wori was
spellbound by her strange wave-like beauty,
her long flowing hair, her soft deep blue eyes.
The maiden stooped to fill her bowl. Suddenly,
she saw the reflection of Prince Fire-Fade
in the water; she dropped the precious
bowl, and it fell in a thousand pieces. Toyo-tama
hastened to her father, and exclaimed,
&ldquo;A man, with the grace and beauty of a god,
sits in the branches of the cassia tree. I have
seen his picture in the waters of the well.&rdquo;
The Sea-King knew that it must be the great
hunter, Prince Fire-Fade.</p>

<p>Then Wata-tsu-mi went forth and stood
under the cassia tree. He looked up to Ho-wori,
and said: &ldquo;Come down, O Son of the
Gods, and enter my Palace of the Ocean-Bed.&rdquo;
Ho-wori obeyed, and was led into
the palace and seated on a throne of sea-asses&rsquo;
skins. A banquet was prepared in his
honour. The <i>hashi</i> were delicate branches of
coral, and the plates were of silvery mother-of-pearl.
The clear-rock wine was sipped
from cup-shaped ocean blooms with long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
slender stalks. Ho-wori thought that never
before had there been such a banquet. When
it was ended he went with Toyo-tama to the
roof of the palace. Dimly, through the blue
waters that moved above, he could discern
the Sun-Goddess. He saw the mountains
and valleys of ocean, the waving forests of
tall sea-plants, the homes of the <i>shak&eacute;</i> and
the <i>kani</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">Suddenly, she saw the reflection of Prince Fire-Fade in the water.</p>
</div>

<p>Ho-wori told Wata-tsu-mi of the loss of
the fish-hook. Then the Sea-King called all
his subjects together and questioned them.
No fish knew aught of the hook, but, said
the lobster: &ldquo;As I sat one day in my crevice
among the rocks, the <i>tai</i> passed near me.
His mouth was swollen, and he went by
without giving me greeting.&rdquo; Wata-tsu-mi
then noticed that the <i>tai</i> had not answered
his summons. A messenger, fleet of fin, was
sent to fetch him. When the <i>tai</i> appeared, the
lost fish-hook was found in his poor wounded
mouth. It was restored to Ho-wori, and
he was happy. Toyo-tama became his bride,
and they lived together in the cool fish-scale
palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
Prince Fire-Fade came to understand the
secrets of the ocean, the cause of its anger,
the cause of its joy. The Storm-Spirit of
the upper sea did not rule in the ocean-bed,
and night after night Ho-wori was
rocked to sleep by the gentle motion of the
waters.</p>

<p>Many tides had ebbed and flowed, when,
in the quiet of the night, Ho-wori heaved a
deep sigh. Toyo-tama was troubled, and told
her father that, as Ho-wori dreamt of his
home on the earth, a great longing had come
over him to visit it once more. Then Wata-tsu-mi
gave into Ho-wori&rsquo;s hands two great
jewels, the one to rule the flow, the other to
rule the ebb of the tide. He spoke thus:
&ldquo;Return to earth on the head of my trusted
sea-dragon. Restore the lost fish-hook to Ho-deri.
If he is still wroth with you, bring forth
the tide-flowing jewel, and the waters shall
cover him. If he asks your forgiveness, bring
forth the tide-ebbing jewel, and it shall be well
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ho-wori left the Palace of the Ocean-Bed,
and was carried swiftly to his own land.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
As he set foot on the shore, he ungirded
his sword, and tied it round the neck of
the sea-dragon. Then he said: &ldquo;Take this
to the Sea-King as a token of my love and
gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> FAIR maiden lay asleep in a rice-field.
The sun was at its height, and she was
weary. Now a god looked down upon the
rice-field. He knew that the beauty of the
maiden came from within, that it mirrored the
beauty of heavenly dreams. He knew that
even now, as she smiled, she held converse
with the spirit of the wind or the flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
The god descended and asked the dream-maiden
to be his bride. She rejoiced, and
they were wed. A wonderful red jewel came
of their happiness.</p>

<p>Long, long afterwards, the stone was found
by a farmer, who saw that it was a very
rare jewel. He prized it highly, and always
carried it about with him. Sometimes, as
he looked at it in the pale light of the moon,
it seemed to him that he could discern
two sparkling eyes in its depths. Again,
in the stillness of the night, he would awaken
and think that a clear soft voice called him
by name.</p>

<p>One day, the farmer had to carry the mid-day
meal to his workers in the field. The sun
was very hot, so he loaded a cow with the
bowls of rice, the millet dumplings, and the
beans. Suddenly, Prince Ama-boko stood in
the path. He was angry, for he thought that
the farmer was about to kill the cow. The
Prince would hear no word of denial; his
wrath increased. The farmer became more
and more terrified, and, finally, took the
precious stone from his pocket and presented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
it as a peace-offering to the powerful Prince.
Ama-boko marvelled at the brilliancy of the
jewel, and allowed the man to continue his
journey.</p>

<p>The Prince returned to his home. He drew
forth the treasure, and it was immediately
transformed into a goddess of surpassing
beauty. Even as she rose before him, he
loved her, and ere the moon waned they were
wed. The goddess ministered to his every
want. She prepared delicate dishes, the secret
of which is known only to the gods. She
made wine from the juice of a myriad herbs,
wine such as mortals never taste.</p>

<p>But, after a time, the Prince became proud
and overbearing. He began to treat his faithful
wife with cruel contempt. The goddess
was sad, and said: &ldquo;You are not worthy
of my love. I will leave you and go to my
father.&rdquo; Ama-boko paid no heed to these
words, for he did not believe that the threat
would be fulfilled. But the beautiful goddess
was in earnest. She escaped from the palace
and fled to Naniwa, where she is still honoured
as Akaru-hime, the Goddess of Light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
Now the Prince was wroth when he heard
that the goddess had left him, and set out in
pursuit of her. But when he neared Naniwa,
the gods would not allow his vessel to enter the
haven. Then he knew that his priceless red
jewel was lost to him for ever. He steered
his ship towards the north coast of Japan,
and landed at Tajima. Here he was well
received, and highly esteemed on account of
the treasures which he brought with him.
He had costly strings of pearls, girdles of
precious stones, and a mirror which the wind
and the waves obeyed. Prince Ama-boko
remained at Tajima, and was the father of a
mighty race.</p>

<p>Among his children&rsquo;s children was a princess
so renowned for her beauty that eighty suitors
sought her hand. One after the other returned
sorrowfully home, for none found favour in her
eyes. At last, two brothers came before her,
the young God of the Autumn, and the young
God of the Spring. The elder of the two, the
God of Autumn, first urged his suit. But the
princess refused him. He went to his younger
brother, and said: &ldquo;The princess does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
love me, neither will you be able to win her
heart.&rdquo; But the Spring God was full of hope,
and replied: &ldquo;I will give you a cask of rice
wine if I do not win her, but if she consents
to be my bride, you shall give a cask of <i>sak&eacute;</i>
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">

alt="" />
<p class="caption">One after the other returned sorrowfully home, for none found favour
in her eyes.</p>
</div>

<p>Now the God of Spring went to his mother,
and told her all. She promised to aid him.
Thereupon she wove, in a single night, a robe
and sandals from the unopened buds of the
lilac and white wisteria. Out of the same
delicate flowers she fashioned a bow and
arrows. Thus clad, the God of Spring made
his way to the beautiful princess.</p>

<p>As he stepped before the maiden, every bud
unfolded, and from the heart of each blossom
came a fragrance that filled the air. The
princess was overjoyed, and gave her hand to
the God of the Spring.</p>

<p>The elder brother, the God of Autumn, was
filled with rage when he heard how his brother
had obtained the wondrous robe. He refused
to give the promised cask of <i>sak&eacute;</i>. When the
mother learned that the god had broken his
word, she placed stones and salt in the hollow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
of a bamboo cane, wrapped it round with
bamboo leaves, and hung it in the smoke.
Then she uttered a curse upon her first-born
son: &ldquo;As the leaves wither and fade, so must
you. As the salt sea ebbs, so must you. As
the stone sinks, so must you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The terrible curse fell upon her son. While
the God of Spring remains ever young, ever
fragrant, ever full of mirth, the God of Autumn
is old, and withered, and sad.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>HOKUJO, daughter
of the Sun, dwelt
with her father on
the banks of the Silver
River of Heaven,
which we call the
Milky Way. She was a
lovely maiden, graceful and
winsome, and her eyes were
tender as the eyes of a dove.
Her loving father, the Sun, was
much troubled because Shokujo did not
share in the youthful pleasures of the daughters
of the air. A soft melancholy seemed to brood
over her, but she never wearied of working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
for the good of others, and especially did she
busy herself at her loom; indeed she came
to be called the Weaving Princess.</p>

<p>The Sun bethought him, that if he could
give his daughter in marriage, all would be
well; her dormant love would be kindled into
a flame that would illumine her whole being
and drive out the pensive spirit which oppressed
her. Now there lived, hard by, one
Kingen, a right honest herdsman, who tended
his cows on the borders of the Heavenly
Stream. The Sun-King proposed to bestow
his daughter on Kingen, thinking in this
way to provide for her happiness and at the
same time to keep her near him. Every
star beamed approval, and there was joy in
the heavens.</p>

<p>The love that bound Shokujo and Kingen
to one another was a great love. With its
awakening, Shokujo forsook her former occupations,
nor did she any longer labour industriously
at the loom, but laughed, and danced,
and sang, and made merry from morn till
night. The Sun-King was sorely grieved, for
he had not foreseen so great a change. Anger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
was in his eyes, and he said, &ldquo;Kingen is
surely the cause of this, therefore I will
banish him to the other side of the River
of Stars.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">

alt="" />
<p class="caption">The lovers were wont, standing on the banks of the celestial stream,
to waft across it sweet and tender messages.</p>
</div>

<p>When Shokujo and Kingen heard that they
were to be parted, and could thenceforth, in
accordance with the King&rsquo;s decree, meet but
once a year, and that upon the seventh night
of the seventh month, their hearts were heavy.
The leave-taking between them was a sad
one, and great tears stood in Shokujo&rsquo;s eyes
as she bade farewell to her lover-husband. In
answer to the behest of the Sun-King, myriads
of magpies flocked together, and, outspreading
their wings, formed a bridge, on which Kingen
crossed the River of Heaven. The moment
that his foot touched the opposite bank, the
birds dispersed with noisy chatter, leaving
poor Kingen a solitary exile. He looked
wistfully towards the weeping figure of Shokujo,
who stood on the threshold of her now
desolate home.</p>

<p>Long and weary were the succeeding days,
spent as they were by Kingen in guiding his
oxen and by Shokujo in plying her shuttle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
The Sun-King was gladdened by his daughter&rsquo;s
industry. When night fell and the heavens
were bright with countless lights, the lovers
were wont, standing on the banks of the celestial
stream, to waft across it sweet and tender
messages, while each uttered a prayer for the
speedy coming of the wondrous night.</p>

<p>The long-hoped-for month and day drew
nigh, and the hearts of the lovers were
troubled lest rain should fall: for the Silver
River, full at all times, is at that season
often in flood, and the bird-bridge might be
swept away.</p>

<p>The day broke cloudlessly bright. It waxed
and waned, and one by one the lamps of
heaven were lighted. At nightfall the magpies
assembled, and Shokujo, quivering with
delight, crossed the slender bridge and fell
into the arms of her lover. Their transport
of joy was as the joy of the parched flower,
when the raindrop falls upon it; but the
moment of parting soon came, and Shokujo
sorrowfully retraced her steps.</p>

<p>Year follows year, and the lovers still meet
in that far-off starry land on the seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
night of the seventh month, save when rain
has swelled the Silver River and rendered
the crossing impossible. The hope of a
permanent reunion still fills the hearts of the
Star-Lovers, and is to them as a sweet
fragrance and a beautiful vision.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>AR beyond the
faint grey of the
horizon, somewhere in the shadowy Unknown,
lies the Island of Eternal Youth. The dwellers
on the rocky coast of the East Sea of
Japan relate that, at times, a wondrous tree
can be discerned rising high above the
waves. It is the tree which has stood for
all ages on the loftiest peak of Fusan, the
Mountain of Immortality. Men rejoice when
they catch a glimpse of its branches, though
the glimpse be fleeting as a vision at
dawn. On the island is endless spring: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
air is ever sweet and the sky blue. Celestial
dews fall softly upon every tree and flower,
and carry with them the secret of eternity.
The delicate white bryony never loses its first-day
freshness, the scarlet lily cannot fade.
Ethereal pink blossoms enfold the branches
of the <i>sakuranoki</i>; the pendulous fruit of the
orange bears no trace of age. Irises, violet and
yellow and blue, fringe the pool on whose surface
float the heavenly-coloured lotus blooms.
From day to day the birds sing of love and
joy. Sorrow and pain are unknown, death
comes not hither. The Spirit of this island
it is who whispers to the sleeping Spring in
every land, and bids her arise.</p>

<p>Many brave seafarers have sought Horaizan
but have not reached its shores. Some have
suffered shipwreck in the attempt, others have
mistaken the heights of Fuji-yama for the
blessed Fusan.</p>

<p>Now there once lived a cruel Emperor of
China. So tyrannical was he that the life of
his physician, Jofuku, was in constant danger.
One day, Jofuku spoke to the Emperor, and
said: &ldquo;Give me a ship, and I will sail to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
Island of Eternal Youth. There I will pluck
the herb of immortality and bring it back to
you, that you may rule over your kingdom
for ever.&rdquo; The despot heard the words with
pleasure. Jofuku, fully equipped, set sail and
came to Japan; thence he steered his course
towards the magic tree. Days, months, and
years passed. Jofuku seemed to be drifting
on the ocean of heaven, for no land was
visible. At last, far in the distance, rose the
dim outline of a hill such as he had never
seen before; and when he perceived a tree on
its summit, Jofuku knew that he neared Horaizan.
Soon he came to its shores, and landed
as one in a dream. Every thought of the
Emperor, whose days were to be prolonged
by eating of the sacred herb, passed from his
mind. Life upon the beautiful island was so
glorious that he had no wish to return. His
story is told by Wasobiowe, a wise man of
Japan, who, alone among mortals, can relate
the wonders of that strange land.</p>

<p>Wasobiowe dwelt in the neighbourhood
of Nagasaki. He loved nothing better than
to spend his days far out at sea, fishing from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
little boat. Once, when the eighth full moon
rose&mdash;which in Japan is called the &ldquo;bean
moon&rdquo; and is the most beautiful of all&mdash;Wasobiowe
started on a long voyage in
order to be absent from Nagasaki during the
festivals of the season. Leisurely he skirted
the coast, and rejoiced in the bold outlines
of the rocks seen by the light of the moon.
But, without warning, black clouds gathered
overhead. The storm burst, the rain poured
down, and darkness fell. The waves were
lashed into fury, and the little boat was
driven swift as an arrow before the wind.
For three days and nights the hurricane
raged. As dawn broke on the fourth morning,
the wind was stilled, the sea grew calm.
Wasobiowe, who knew the course of the stars,
saw that he was far from his home in Japan.
He was at the mercy of the god of the tides.
For months Wasobiowe ate the fish which he
caught in his net, until his boat drifted into
those black waters where no fish can live.
He rowed and rowed; his strength was
almost spent. Hope had left him, when, suddenly,
a fragrant wind from the land played
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
about his temples. He seized the oars, and
soon his boat reached the coast of Horaizan.
Even as he landed, all remembrance
of the dangers and privations of the voyage
vanished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">

<img src="images/owj16.jpg" width="373" height="600"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Soon he came to its shores, and landed as one in a dream.</p>
</div>

<p>Everything spoke of joy and sunlight.
The hum of the cicala, the whirr of the
darting dragon-fly, the call of the bright-green
tree-frog sounded in his ear. Sweet scents
came from the pine-covered hills; everywhere
was a flood of glowing colour.</p>

<p>Presently a man approached him. It was
none other than Jofuku. He spoke to Wasobiowe,
and told how the elect of the gods,
who peopled those remote shores, filled their
days with music and laughter and song.</p>

<p>Wasobiowe lived contentedly on the Island
of Eternal Youth. He knew nothing of the
flight of years, for where there is no birth, no
death, time passes unheeded.</p>

<p>But, after many hundred years, the wise
man of Nagasaki wearied of this blissful existence.
He longed for death, but the dark river
does not flow through Horaizan. He would
wistfully follow the outward flight of the birds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
till they became mere specks in the sky.
One day he spoke to a pure white stork: &ldquo;I
know that the birds alone can leave this island.
Carry me, I pray you, to my home in Japan.
I would see it once more and die.&rdquo; Then
he mounted upon the outstretched wings of
the stork, and was carried across the sea and
through many strange lands, peopled by giants
and dwarfs and men with white faces. When
he had visited all the countries of the earth, he
came to his beloved Japan. In his hand he
bore a branch of the orange which he planted.
The tree still flourishes in the Mikado&rsquo;s
Empire.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>T the
foot of the
snowy mountain of
Haku-san, in the province
of Echizen, lived a peasant and his
wife. They were very poor, for their little
strip of barren mountain-land yielded but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
one scanty crop a year, while their neighbours
in the valley gathered two rich harvests.
With unceasing patience, Bimbo worked from
cock-crow until the barking of the foxes
warned him that night had fallen. He laid
out his plot of ground in terraces, surrounded
them with dams, and diverted the course of
the mountain stream that it might flood his
fields. But when no rain came to swell
the brook, Bimbo&rsquo;s harvest failed. Often as
he sat in his hut with his wife, after a long
day of hard work, he would speak of their
troubles. The peasants were filled with grief
that a child had not been given to them.
They longed to adopt a son, but, as they had
barely enough for their own simple wants, the
dream could not be realised.</p>

<p>An evil day came when the land of Echizen
was parched. No rain fell. The brook was
dried up. The young rice-sprouts withered.
Bimbo sighed heavily over his work. He
looked up to the sky and entreated the gods
to take pity on him.</p>

<p>After many weeks of sunshine, the sky was
overcast. Single clouds came up rapidly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
from the west, and gathered in angry masses.
A strange silence filled the air. Even the
voice of the cicalas, who had chirped in the
trees during the heat of the day, was stilled.
Only the cry of the mountain hawk was
audible. A murmur passed over valley and
hill, a faint rustling of leaves, a whispering
sigh in the needles of the fir. Fu-ten, the
Storm-Spirit, and Rai-den, the Thunder-God,
were abroad. Deeper and deeper sank the
clouds under the weight of the thunder dragon.
The rain came at first in large cool drops,
then in torrents.</p>

<p>Bimbo rejoiced, and worked steadily to
strengthen the dams and open the conduits
of his farm.</p>

<p>A vivid flash of lightning, a mighty roar of
thunder! Terrified, almost blinded, Bimbo fell
on his knees. He thought that the claws of
the thunder dragon were about him. But he
was unharmed, and he offered thanks to
Kwan-non, the Goddess of Pity, who protects
mortals from the wrath of the Thunder-God.
On the spot where the lightning struck
the ground, lay a little rosy boy full of life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
who held out his arms and lisped. Bimbo
was greatly amazed, and his heart was glad, for
he knew that the gods had heard and answered
his never-uttered prayer. The happy peasant
took the child up, and carried him under his
rice-straw coat to the hut. He called to his
wife, &ldquo;Rejoice, our wish is fulfilled. The
gods have sent us a child. We will call him
Rai-taro, the Son of the Thunder-God, and
bring him up as our own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good woman fondly tended the boy.
Rai-taro loved his foster-parents, and grew up
dutiful and obedient. He did not care to play
with other children, but was always happy to
work in the fields with Bimbo, where he would
watch the flight of the birds, and listen to the
sound of the wind. Long-before Bimbo could
discern any sign of an approaching storm,
Rai-taro knew that it was at hand. When it
drew near, he fixed his eyes intently on the
gathering clouds, he listened eagerly to the
roll of the thunder, the rush of the rain, and
he greeted each flash of lightning with a shout
of joy.</p>

<p>Rai-taro had come as a ray of sunshine

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
into the lives of the poor peasants. Good
fortune followed the farmer from the day that
he carried the little boy home in his raincoat.
The mountain stream was never dry.
The land was fertile, and he gathered rich
harvests of rice and abundant crops of millet.
Year by year, his prosperity increased, until
from Bimbo, &lsquo;the poor,&rsquo; he became Kane-mochi,
&lsquo;the prosperous.&rsquo;</p>

<p>About eighteen summers passed, and Rai-taro
still lived with his foster-parents. Suddenly,
they knew not why, he became thoughtful
and sad. Nothing would rouse him. The
peasants determined to hold a feast in honour
of his birthday. They called together the
neighbours, and there was much rejoicing.
Bimbo told many tales of other days, and,
finally, of how Rai-taro came to him out of
the storm. As he ceased, a strange far-off
look was in the eyes of the Son of the
Thunder-God. He stood before his foster-parents,
and said: &ldquo;You have loved me
well. You have been faithful and kind.
But the time has come for me to leave you.
Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
In a moment Rai-taro was gone. A white
cloud floated upward towards the heights of
Haku-san. As it neared the summit of the
mountain, it took the form of a white dragon.
Higher still the dragon soared, until, at last,
it vanished into a castle of clouds.</p>

<p>The peasants looked wistfully up to the
sky. They hoped that Rai-taro might return,
but he had joined his father, Rai-den, the
Thunder-God, and was seen no more.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>AI-NO-KAWARA,
the Dry Bed of the
River of Souls. Far
below the roots of the
mountains, far below the
bottom of the sea is the
course of this river. Ages ago
its current bore the souls of the
blessed dead to the Land of Eternal
Peace. The wicked <i>oni</i> were
angry when they saw the good spirits
pass out of their reach on the
breast of the river. They muttered
curses in their throats
as the stream flowed on day
by day, year by year. The
snow-white soul of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
tender child came to the bank. A cup-shaped
lotus bloom waited to carry the little one
swiftly, through the dark cavernous region, to
the kingdom of joy. The <i>oni</i> gnashed their
teeth. The spirit of a kindly old man, whose
heart was young, would thread his way unharmed,
through the horde of demons, and
float on the Heavenly-Bird-Boat to the unknown
world. The <i>oni</i> looked on in wrath.</p>

<p>But the <i>oni</i> stemmed the River of Souls at
its source, and now the spirits of the dead
must wend their way, unaided, to the country
that lies far beyond.</p>

<p>Jizo, The Never-Slumbering, is the god who
guards the souls of little children. He is full
of pity, his voice is gentle as the voice of the
doves on Mount Hasa, his love is infinite as
the waters of the sea. To him every child
in the Land of the Gods calls for succour
and protection.</p>

<p>In Sai-no-Kawara, The Dry Bed of the
River of Souls, are the spirits of countless
children. Babes of two and three years old,
babes of four and five, children of eight and
ten. Their wailing is pitiful to hear. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
cry for the mother who bore them. They cry
for the father who cherished them. They
cry for the brother and sister whom they
love. Their cry is heard throughout Sai-no-Kawara,
a cry that rises and falls, and falls
and rises, rhythmic, unceasing. These are
the words that they cry&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chichi koishi! haha koishi!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their voices grow hoarse as they cry, and
still they cry on&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chichi koishi! haha koishi!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While day lasts, they cry and they gather
stones from the bed of the river, and heap
them together as prayers.</p>

<p>A Tower of Prayer for the sweet mother,
as they cry:</p>

<p>A Tower of Prayer for the father, as they cry:</p>

<p>A Tower of Prayer for brother and sister,
as they cry:</p>

<p>From morning till evening they cry&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chichi koishi! haha koishi!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and heap up the stones of prayer.</p>

<p>At nightfall come the <i>oni</i>, the demons, and
say: &ldquo;Why do you cry, why do you pray?
Your parents in the Shaba-World cannot hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
you. Your prayers are lost in the strife of
tongues. The lamentation of your parents on
earth is the cause of all your sorrow.&rdquo; So
saying, the wicked <i>oni</i> cast down the Towers
of Prayer, every one, and dash the stones into
great caverns of the rocks.</p>

<p>But Jizo, with a great love in his eyes,
comes and enfolds the little ones in his robe.
To the babes who cannot walk, he stretches
forth his <i>shakujo</i>. The children in Sai-no-Kawara
gather round him, and he speaks
sweet words of comfort. He lifts them in
his arms and caresses them, for Jizo is father
and mother to the little ones who dwell in the
Dry Bed of the River of Souls.</p>

<p>Then they cease from their crying: they
cease to build the Towers of Prayer. Night
has come, and the souls of the children sleep
peacefully, while The Never-Slumbering Jizo
watches over them.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was early spring on
the coast of Suruga.
Tender green flushed the
bamboo thickets. A rose-tinged
cloud from heaven had fallen softly
on the branches of the cherry tree. The pine
forests were fragrant of the spring. Save for
the lap of the sea, there was silence on that
remote shore.</p>

<p>A far-off sound became audible: it might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
the song of falling waters, it might be the
voice of the awakening wind, it might be the
melody of the clouds. The strange sweet
music rose and fell: the cadence was as the
cadence of the sea. Slowly, imperceptibly,
the music came nearer.</p>

<p>Above the lofty heights of Fuji-yama a
snow-white cloud floated earthwards. Nearer
and nearer came the music. A low clear
voice could be heard chanting a lay that
breathed of the peace and tranquillity of the
moonlight. The fleecy cloud was borne towards
the shore. For one moment it seemed
to rest upon the sand, and then it melted
away.</p>

<p>By the sea stood a glistening maiden. In
her hand she carried a heart-shaped instrument,
and, as her fingers touched the strings,
she sang a heavenly song. She wore a robe
of feathers, white and spotless as the breast of
the wild swan. The maiden looked at the sea.
Then she moved towards the belt of pine trees
that fringed the shore. Birds flocked around
her; they perched on her shoulder, and
rubbed their soft heads against her cheek.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
She stroked them gently and they flew away
full of joy. The maiden hung her robe of
feathers on a pine branch, and went to bathe
in the sea.</p>

<p>It was mid-day. A fisher sat down among
the pines to eat his dumpling. Suddenly, his
eye fell on the dazzling white robe. &ldquo;Perhaps
it is a gift from the gods,&rdquo; said Hairukoo as he
went up to it. The robe was so fragile that he
almost feared to touch it, but at last he took it
down. The feathers were wondrously woven
together, and slender curved wings sprang
from above the shoulder. &ldquo;I will take it
home, and we shall be happy,&rdquo; he thought.</p>

<p>Now the maiden came from the sea. Hairukoo
heard no sound until she stood before
him. Then a soft voice spoke: &ldquo;The robe is
mine, good fisher, pray give it to me.&rdquo; The
man stood awestruck, for never had he seen
so lovely a being. She seemed to come from
another world. He said, &ldquo;What is your
name, beautiful maiden, and whence do you
come?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I am one of the
virgins who attend the moon. I come with a
message of peace to the ocean. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
whispered it into his ear, and now I must fly
heavenward.&rdquo; But Hairukoo replied, &ldquo;I
would see you dance before you leave me.&rdquo;
The moon-maiden answered: &ldquo;Give me my
feather robe, and I will dance a celestial
dance.&rdquo; The peasant refused. &ldquo;Dance and
I will give you your robe.&rdquo; Then the glittering
virgin was angry: &ldquo;The wicked <i>oni</i> will
take you for their own, if you doubt the word
of a goddess. I cannot dance without my
robe. Each feather has been given to me by
the Heavenly Birds. Their love and trust
support me.&rdquo; As she thus spoke the fisher
was ashamed, and said, &ldquo;I have done wrong,
and I ask your forgiveness.&rdquo; Then he gave
the robe into her hands. The moon-maiden
put it around her.</p>

<p>And now she rose from the ground. She
touched the stringed instrument and sang.
Clear and infinitely sweet came the notes. It
was her farewell to the earth and the sea. It
ceased. She broke into a merry trilling
song, and began to dance. At one moment
she skimmed the surface of the sea, the next
her tiny feet touched the topmost branches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
the tall pine trees. Then she sped past the
fisher and smiled as the long grass rustled
beneath her. She swept through the air, in
and out among the trees, over the bamboo
thicket, and under the branches of the blossoming
cherry. Still the music went on. Still
the maiden danced. Hairukoo looked on in
wonder: he thought it must all be a beautiful
dream.</p>

<p class="caption">At one moment she skimmed the surface of the sea, the next her tiny feet

</div>

<p>But now the music changed. It was no
longer merry. The dance ended. The maiden
sang of the moonlight, and of the quiet of
evening.</p>

<p>She began to circle in the air. Slowly at
first, then more swiftly, she floated over the
woods towards the distant mountain. The
music and the song rang in the ears of the
fisher. The maiden was wafted farther and
farther away. Hairukoo watched until he
could no longer discern her snow-white form
in the sky. But still the music reached him on
the breeze. At last it too died away. The
fisher was left alone: alone with the sound
of the sea, and the fragrance of the pines.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE cherry tree has
blossomed many
times since O-Matsue
lived with her father
and mother on the sandy
coast of the Inland Sea.
The home at Takasago
was sheltered by a tall
fir tree of great age; a
god had planted it as he
passed that way. O-Matsue
was beautiful, for
her mother had taught
her to love the sea,
and the birds, the trees,
and every living thing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
Her eyes were like a clear deep ocean-pool
on a summer day. Her smile was
as the sunshine on the surface of Lake
Biwa.</p>

<p>The fallen needles of the fir made a soft
couch on which O-Matsue sat for hours at a
time, plying her shuttle, weaving robes for
the peasants around. Sometimes, she would
go to sea with the fishers, and peer into the
depths to try and catch a glimpse of the
Palace of the Ocean Bed; the fishers would
tell her the story of the poor jelly-fish who
lost his shell, or of the Blessed Island of
Eternal Youth, whose tree could at times be
discerned from the coast.</p>

<p>The steep shore of Sumi-no-ye is many
leagues distant from Takasago, but a youth
who dwelt there took a long journey. Teoyo
said, &ldquo;I will see what lies beyond the mountains.
I will see the country to which the
heron wings his way across the plain.&rdquo; He
travelled through many provinces, and at last
came to the land of Harima. One day he
passed by Takasago. O-Matsue sat in the
shade of the fir tree. She was weaving, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
sang as she worked. These are the words of
her song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;No man so callous but he heaves a sigh</div>
<div class="i1">When o&rsquo;er his head the withered Cherry flowers</div>
<div class="i1">Come fluttering down. Who knows? the Spring&rsquo;s soft showers</div>
<div class="i0">May be but tears shed by the sorrowing sky.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Teoyo heard the sweet song, and said,
&ldquo;It is like the song of a spirit,&mdash;and how
beautiful the maiden is!&rdquo; For some time he
watched her as she wove. Then her song
ceased, he moved towards her, and spoke:
&ldquo;I have travelled far. I have seen many
fair maidens, but not one so fair as you.
Take me to your father and mother that I
may speak with them.&rdquo; Teoyo asked the
peasants for the hand of their daughter, and
they gave their consent.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing. O-Matsue
received many presents, and, as the wedding-day
approached, a great feast was prepared.
Bride and bridegroom drank thrice of three
cups of <i>sak&eacute;</i> which made them man and wife,
and the feast went on.</p>

<p>Now Teoyo said, &ldquo;This country of Harima
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
is a good land. Let us stay here with your
father and mother.&rdquo; O-Matsue was glad. So
they dwelt with the old people under the great
fir tree. At last, the father and mother died.
O-Matsue and Teoyo still lived beneath the
shelter of the tree. They were very happy.
Summer, autumn and winter passed over the
land of Harima many times. Their love was
always in its spring. The &ldquo;waves of age&rdquo;
furrowed their brows, but their hearts remained
young and tender, green as the needles
of the pine. Even when their eyes had grown
dim, they went to the shore to listen to the
waters of the Inland Sea, or together they
gathered, with rakes of bamboo, the fallen
needles of the fir.</p>

<p>A crane came and built in the topmost
branches of the tree, and for many years they
watched the birds rear their young. A tortoise
also dwelt beside them. O-Matsue said,
&ldquo;We are blessed with a fir tree, a crane, and
a tortoise. The God of Long Life has taken
us under his care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When, at last, at the same moment, Teoyo
and O-Matsue died, their spirits withdrew into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
the tree which had for so long been the
witness of their happiness. To this day the
pine tree is called &ldquo;The Pine of the Lovers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On moonbright nights, when the coast wind
whispers in the branches of the tree, O-Matsue
and Teoyo may sometimes be seen, with bamboo
rakes in their hands, gathering together
the needles of the fir.</p>

<p>Despite the storms of time, the old tree
stands to this hour eternally green on the high
shore of Takasago.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>OT far from Matsue, the great city of the
Province of the Gods, there once dwelt a
widow and her son. Their wooden hut looked
upon the Shinji Lake set in a framework of
mountain peaks. Ayame was true to the old
religion, the worship of the descendants of
Izanagi and Izanami. Long ere the sun rose
above the chain of hills, she was up, and, with
Umewaki&rsquo;s hand clasped closely in her own,
went down to the verge of the lake. First
they laved their faces in the cool water, then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
turning towards the east, they clapped their
hands four times and saluted the sun. &ldquo;Konnichi
Sama! All hail to thee, Day-Maker.
Shine and bring joy to the Place of the Issuing
of Clouds.&rdquo; Then, having turned towards the
west, mother and son blessed the holy, immemorial
shrine of Kitzuki; towards the north
and the south they turned and prayed to the
gods, unto each one, who dwell in the blue
Plain of High Heaven.</p>

<p>Umewaki&rsquo;s father had been dead many years,
and the love of the mother was centred upon
her son. He was in the open air from sunrise
to nightfall; sometimes by Ayame&rsquo;s side,
sometimes alone, watching the heron or the
crane, or listening to the sweet call of the
<i>yamabato</i>. The hut was in a remote spot, but
Ayame felt that her son was safe in the keeping
of the good gods.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful summer morning. Ayame
and Umewaki awakened soon after dawn.
Hand in hand they went to the shore of Lake
Shinji. It still slept beneath the faintly-tinged
haze. The Lady of Fire had not whispered
of her approach to the soft mists that veiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
the hills. Mother and son waited patiently.
As the Day-Maker appeared, they cried,
&ldquo;Konnichi Sama! Great Goddess, shine upon
thy land. Give it beauty and peace and joy.&rdquo;
Then mother and son returned to the hut.
Ayame plied her shuttle, and Umewaki left
her to wander in the woods.</p>

<p>Noon came. &ldquo;My boy has met some woodcutter;
he talks with him in the shade of the
pine trees,&rdquo; she thought. As the evening drew
on, she said, &ldquo;He is with little Kime, his playmate,
but I shall soon hear his soft footstep.&rdquo;
Night fell. &ldquo;Once only has he been so late;
when he went to Matsue with the good Shijo.&rdquo;
She looked through the paper window, and
then stepped out. The hills cast a mysterious
shadow on the surface of the lake. Still there
was no sign of Umewaki. The mother called
his name. No response came save the echo
of her own voice. Now she searched far
and near. To every peasant she put the
question, &ldquo;Have you seen my Umewaki?&rdquo;
But she always received the same answer. At
last she returned home weary: &ldquo;He may
be there waiting for me,&rdquo; she thought. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
was midnight: the hut was empty. Ayame
was heavy at heart, and as she lay upon
her mat she wept bitterly, and cried to the
gods to give her back her son. So the night
passed. In the morning she learned that a
band of robbers had been seen among the
mountains.</p>

<p>Poor Umewaki had, in truth, been stolen by
the robbers. He was watched night and day,
and had no chance of escape. From town to
town they travelled. Through strange villages
where the name of Buddha was upon the
lips of the people, across great plains unsheltered
by mountains. The summer passed,
and autumn came. Still the men would not
let Umewaki go. They treated him cruelly,
and he began to pine away. Then the robbers
knew that he was of no use to them. As they
neared Yedo, they left him, faint and weary,
on the roadside. A kind man of Mukochima
found the poor little fellow and carried him to
his home. But Umewaki had not long to live.
On the fifteenth day of the third month, the
day sacred to the awakening of the Spring,
he opened his eyes, and called to the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
woman who tended him, &ldquo;Tell my dear mother
that I love her, and would stay with her, but
the Lady of the Great Light calls me, and I
must obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ayame had left her quiet hut by the lake of
Shinji to follow the men who had stolen her son.
The autumn and the winter had gone by, and
still she persevered. As she passed through
Mukochima, she heard that a poor boy was
dead, and soon found that it was her son.
She went to the house where he had been
cared for, and the woman gave her Umewaki&rsquo;s
message.</p>

<p>In the evening, when all was quiet, Ayame
crept to the graveside of her child. Near it a
sacred willow was planted. The slender tree
moved in the wind. There was a whispered
sound: the voice of Umewaki speaking softly
to the mother from his place of rest. She
was happy.</p>

<p>Every evening she came to listen to the
sighing of the willow. Every evening she lay
down happy to have spoken to her son.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth day of the third month,
the day of the awakening of the Spring, many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
pilgrims visit the resting-place of Umewaki. If
it rains on that day, the people say, &ldquo;Umewaki
weeps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The willow is under the protection of the
gods. Storm and rain can do it no hurt.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>AKATO-NO-TOKI-YUKI
was a brave warrior
at the court of Ky&#333;to.
He fought for the Minamoto
against the Taira, but
the Minamoto were defeated,
and Sakato&rsquo;s last days were spent as a
wandering exile. He died of a broken heart.
His widow, the daughter of a noble house,
escaped from Ky&#333;to, and fled eastward to the
rugged Ashigara mountains. No one knew
of her hiding-place, and she had no enemies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
to fear save the wild beasts who lived in
the forest. At night she found shelter in a
rocky cave.</p>

<p>A son was born to her whom she named
Kintaro, the Golden Boy. He was a sturdy
little fellow, with ruddy cheeks and merry
laughing eyes. Even as he lay crowing in his
bed among the fern, the birds that alighted
on his shoulder peeped trustfully into his
eyes, and he smiled. Thus early the child
and the birds were comrades. The butterfly
and the downy moth would settle upon his
breast, and tread softly over his little brown
body.</p>

<p>Kintaro was not as other children&mdash;there
was something strange about him. When he
fell, he would laugh cheerily; if he wandered
far into the wood, he could always find his way
home; and, when little more than a chubby
babe, he could swing a heavy axe in circles
round his head. In the remote hills he had
no human companions, but the animals were
his constant playfellows. He was gentle and
kind-hearted, and would not willingly hurt any
living creature; therefore it was that the birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
and all the forest people looked upon Kintaro
as one of themselves.</p>

<p>Among Kintaro&rsquo;s truest friends were the
bears who dwelt in the woods. A mother
bear often carried him on her back to her
home. The cubs ran out and greeted him
joyfully, and they romped and played together
for hours. They wrestled and strove in
friendly rivalry. Sometimes Kintaro would
clamber up the smooth-barked monkey tree,
sit on the topmost branch, and laugh at the
vain attempts of the shaggy little fellows to
follow him. Then came supper-time and the
feast of liquid honey.</p>

<p>But the Golden Boy loved best of all to fly
through the air with his arms round the neck
of a gentle-eyed stag. Soon after dawn, the
deer came to awaken the sleeper, and, with a
farewell kiss to his mother and a morning
caress to the stag, Kintaro sprang on his back
and was carried, with swift bounds, up mountain
side, through valley and thicket, until the
sun was high in the heavens. When they
came to a leafy spot in the woods and heard
the sound of falling water, the stag grazed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
among the high fern while Kintaro bathed in
the foaming torrent.</p>

<p>Thus mother and son lived securely in their
home among the mountains. They saw no
human being save the few woodcutters who
penetrated thus far into the forest, and these
simple peasants did not guess their noble
birth. The mother was known as Yama-uba-San,
&ldquo;The Wild Nurse of the Mountain,&rdquo;
and her son as &ldquo;Little Wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kintaro reigned as prince of the forest,
beloved of every living creature. When he
held his court, the bear and the wolf, the fox
and the badger, the marten and the squirrel,
and many other courtiers were seated around
him. The birds, too, flocked at his call. The
eagle and the hawk flew down from the distant
heights; the crane and the heron swept
over the plain, and feathered friends without
number thronged the branches of the cedars.
He listened as they told of their joys and their
sorrows, and spoke graciously to all, for
Kintaro had learned the language and lore of
the beasts, and the birds, and the flowers, from
the Tengus, the wood-elves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
The Tengus, who live in the rocky heights
of the mountains and in the topmost branches
of lofty trees, befriended Kintaro and became
his teachers. As he was truthful and good,
he had nothing to fear from them; but the
Tengus are dreaded by deceitful boys, whose
tongues they pull out by their roots and carry
away.</p>

<p>These elves are strange beings: with the
body of a man, the head of a hawk, long, long
noses, and two powerful claws on their hairy
hands and feet. They are hatched from eggs,
and, in their youth, have feathers and wings:
later, they moult and wear the garb of men.
On their feet are stilt-like clogs about twelve
inches high. They stalk proudly along with
crossed arms, head thrown back, and long
nose held high in the air; hence the proverb,
&ldquo;He has become a Tengu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The headquarters of the tribe are in the
&#332;yama mountain, where lives the Dai-Tengu,
their leader, whom all obey. He is
even more proud and overbearing than his
followers, and his nose is so long that one of
his ministers always precedes him that it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
not be injured. A long grey beard reaches
to his girdle, and moustaches hang from his
mouth to his chin. His sceptre is a fan of
seven feathers, which he carries in his left
hand. He rarely speaks, and is thus accounted
wondrous wise. The Raven-Tengu
is his chief minister; instead of a nose and
mouth, he has a long beak. Over the left
shoulder is slung an executioners axe, and
in his hand he bears the book of Tengu
wisdom.</p>

<p>The Tengus are fond of games, and their
long noses are useful in many ways. They
serve as swords for fencing, and as poles on
the point of which to balance bowls of water
with gold-fish. Two noses joined together
form a tight-rope on which a young Tengu,
sheltered by a paper umbrella and leading a
little dog, dances and jumps through hoops;
the while an old Tengu sings a dance-tune
and another beats time with a fan. Some
among the older Tengus are very wise. The
most famous of all is he who dwells on the
Kurama mountain, but hardly less wise is
the Tengu who undertook the education of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
Kintaro. At nightfall he carried the boy to the
nest in the high rocks. Here he was taught
the wisdom of the elves, and the speech of all
the forest tribes.</p>

<p>One day, Little Wonder was at play with
some young Tengus, but they grew tired and
flew up to their nest, leaving Kintaro alone.
He was angry with them, and shook the tree
with all his strength, so that the nest fell to the
ground. The mother soon returned, and was
in great distress at the loss of her children.
Kintaro&rsquo;s kind heart was touched, and, with the
little ones in his arms, he swarmed up the tree
and asked pardon. Happily they were unhurt,
and soon recovered from their fright. Kintaro
helped to rebuild the nest, and brought presents
to his playfellows.</p>

<p>Now it happened that, as the hero Raiko,
who had fought so bravely against the <i>oni</i>,
passed through the forest, he came upon Little
Wonder wrestling with a powerful bear. An
admiring circle of friends stood around. Raiko,
as he looked, was amazed at the strength and
courage of the boy. The combat over, he
asked Kintaro his name and his story, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
the child could only lead him to his mother.
When she learned that the man before her
was indeed Raiko, the mighty warrior, she told
him of her flight from Ky&#333;to, of the birth of
Kintaro, and of their secluded life among the
mountains. Raiko wished to take the boy
away and train him in arms, but Kintaro loved
the forest. When, however, his mother spoke,
he was ready to obey. He called together his
friends, the beasts and the birds, and, in words
that are remembered to this day, bade them
all farewell.</p>

<p>The mother would not follow her son to the
land of men, but Kintaro, when he became a
great hero, often came to see her in the home
of his childhood.</p>

<p>The peasants of the Ashigara still tell of
The Wild Nurse of the Mountains and Little
Wonder.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the
five tall
pine trees on the
windy heights of
Mionoseki were but tiny shoots, there lived in
the Kingdom of the Islands a pious man. His
home was in a remote hamlet surrounded by
mountains and great forests of pine. Tsunu
had a wife and sons and daughters. He
was a woodman, and his days were spent in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
the forest and on the hillsides. In summer he
was up at cock-crow, and worked patiently, in
the soft light under the pines, until nightfall.
Then, with his burden of logs and branches,
he went slowly homeward. After the evening
meal, he would tell some old story or
legend. Tsunu was never weary of relating
the wondrous tales of the Land of the
Gods. Best of all he loved to speak of Fuji-yama,
the mountain that stood so near his
home.</p>

<p>In times gone by, there was no mountain
where now the sacred peak reaches up to
the sky; only a far-stretching plain bathed in
sunlight all day. The peasants in the district
were astonished, one morning, to behold a
mighty hill where before had been the open
plain. It had sprung up in a single night,
while they slept. Flames and huge stones
were hurled from its summit; the peasants
feared that the demons from the under-world
had come to wreak vengeance upon them.
But for many generations there have been
peace and silence on the heights. The good
Sun-Goddess loves Fuji-yama. Every evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
she lingers on his summit, and when at
last she leaves him, his lofty crest is bathed
in soft purple light. In the evening the
Matchless Mountain seems to rise higher and
higher into the skies, until no mortal can tell
the place of his rest. Golden clouds enfold
Fuji-yama in the early morning. Pilgrims
come from far and near, to gain blessing and
health for themselves and their families from
the sacred mountain.</p>

<p>On the self-same night that Fuji-yama rose
out of the earth, a strange thing happened in
the mountainous district near Ky&#333;to. The
inhabitants were awakened by a terrible roar,
which continued throughout the night. In the
morning every mountain had disappeared; not
one of the hills that they loved was to be
seen. A blue lake lay before them. It was
none other than the lute-shaped Lake Biwa.
The mountains had, in truth, travelled under
the earth for more than a hundred miles, and
now form the sacred Fuji-yama.</p>

<p>As Tsunu stepped out of his hut in the
morning, his eyes sought the Mountain of
the Gods. He saw the golden clouds, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
the beautiful story was in his mind as he went
to his work.</p>

<p>One day the woodman wandered farther
than usual into the forest. At noon he was
in a very lonely spot. The air was soft and
sweet, the sky so blue that he looked long at
it, and then took a deep breath. Tsunu was
happy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<a name="owj27" id="owj27"></a>
<img src="images/owj27.jpg" width="375" height="600"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">On a plot of mossy grass beyond the thicket, sat two maidens of
surpassing beauty.</p>
</div>

<p>Now his eye fell on a little fox who watched
him curiously from the bushes; The creature
ran away when it saw that the man&rsquo;s attention
had been attracted. Tsunu thought, &ldquo;I will
follow the little fox and see where she goes.&rdquo;
Off he started in pursuit. He soon came to
a bamboo thicket. The smooth slender stems
waved dreamily, the pale green leaves still
sparkled with the morning dew. But it was
not this which caused the woodman to stand
spellbound. On a plot of mossy grass beyond
the thicket, sat two maidens of surpassing
beauty. They were partly shaded by the
waving bamboos, but their faces were lit up
by the sunlight. Not a word came from their
lips, yet Tsunu knew that the voices of both
must be sweet as the cooing of the wild dove.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
The maidens were graceful as the slender
willow, they were fair as the blossom of the
cherry tree. Slowly they moved the chess-men
which lay before them on the grass.
Tsunu hardly dared to breathe, lest he should
disturb them. The breeze caught their long
hair, the sunlight played upon it.... The
sun still shone.... The chess-men were
still slowly moved to and fro.... The
woodman gazed enraptured.</p>



<p class="break">&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; thought Tsunu, &ldquo;I must return,
and tell those at home of the beautiful
maidens.&rdquo; Alas, his knees were stiff and
weak. &ldquo;Surely I have stood here for many
hours,&rdquo; he said. He leaned for support upon
his axe; it crumbled into dust. Looking
down, he saw that a flowing white beard
hung from his chin.</p>

<p>For many hours the poor woodman tried
in vain to reach his home. Fatigued and
wearied, he came at last to a hut. But all
was changed. Strange faces peered curiously
at him. The speech of the people
was unfamiliar. &ldquo;Where are my wife and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
my children?&rdquo; he cried. But no one knew
his name.</p>

<p>Finally, the poor woodman came to understand
that seven generations had passed since
he bade farewell to his dear ones in the early
morning. While he had gazed at the beautiful
maidens, his wife, his children, and his
children&rsquo;s children, had lived and died.</p>

<p>The few remaining years of Tsunu&rsquo;s life
were spent as a pious pilgrim to Fuji-yama,
his well-loved mountain.</p>

<p>Since his death he has been honoured as
a saint who brings prosperity to the people of
his native country.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>EEP in the pinky petals of a lotus bloom
that grew in the castle moats of Fukui,
in Echizen, lived Hi-O, the King of the Fire-Flies.
In this beautiful flower his daughter,
the Princess Hotaru, passed her childhood
exploring every shady nook and fragrant
corner of the bell-like palace, listening to the
buzz of life around, and peeping over the edge
of the petals at the wonderful world which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
lay mysteriously beyond. Hotaru-Him&eacute; had
few youthful companions, but, as she daily
bade her father farewell, she dreamed of the
time when she, too, would fly abroad, and
her brilliant light would attract universal
admiration.</p>

<p>Gradually, a beautiful sheen o&rsquo;erspread her
body; night by night it became brighter, until
at last her home, in the hours of darkness,
was as a globe of coral wherein shone a
lamp of gold. So glorious was her light
that the stars paled before it, and the bright
sickle moon withdrew behind a cloud from
jealousy.</p>

<p>Him&eacute; was now allowed to fly from her
home, to loiter among the pleasant rice
fields, and to explore the indigo meadows
which lay far off on the horizon. She had
no lack of friends and would-be lovers;
thousands of insects, attracted by her magic
light, came and offered their homage, but
Him&eacute; never forgot that she was of royal
blood, and, while she haughtily thanked her
many suitors, none found a way into her
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
One evening the Princess, seated on a
throne formed by the heart of the lotus, held
her court. Soon the faint roseate petals of the
flower were thronged with a host of ardent
lovers. But the Princess whispered to herself,
&ldquo;Only he who loves me more than life
shall call me bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The golden beetle laid his fortunes at her
feet, the cockchafer wooed her in passionate
words, the dragon-fly proudly proffered his
hand, and the hawk-moth humbly, yet persistently,
addressed her. Countless other insects
gained audience, but her answer was ever
the same, &ldquo;Go, and bring me fire, and I will
be your bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One by one they took wing, enraptured by
the hope of success, and unconscious that
they were all bent on the self-same errand.
The hawk-moth entered the Buddhist Temple
and circled round and round the tall wax
lights, until, in an ecstasy of love, he flew
into the flame, exclaiming, &ldquo;Now to win
the Princess or meet my death!&rdquo; His poor
singed body fell heavily to the ground. The
beetle watched intently, for a moment or two,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
the log fire crackling on the hearth, and then,
regardless of his fate, boldly caught at a
tongue of flame he hoped to carry to Him&eacute;&mdash;but
his end was that of the hawk-moth.
The dragon-fly, notwithstanding his sunlit
splendours, could not fulfil the bidding of
the Lady of the Lotus Bloom; he also fell
a prey to her imperious command. Other
lovers there were who tried to steal from
the diamond his heart of fire, who winged
their way to the summit of Fukui, or sped
to the depths of the valleys in search of
the talisman that was to make Him&eacute; their
bride. The sun rose in morning splendour
over untold numbers of dead bodies, which
alone remained to tell of the great devotion
that had inspired the lovers of Princess
Hotaru.</p>

<p>Now tidings came to Hi-Maro, a Prince of
the Fire-Flies living hard by, that the Princess
Hotaru was exceedingly beautiful; whereupon
he flew swiftly to her home among the lotus
flowers. Even as, with a flood of golden
light, he entered, the charms of Him&eacute; were not
dimmed. One look passed between the youth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
and the maiden, and then each felt that a
great love filled their hearts. Hi-Maro wooed
and wed, and for many years lived happily
with Hotaru-Him&eacute; in the castle moats of
Fukui.</p>

<p>Centuries have passed since Hi-Maro won
his bride, and still the dazzling fire-fly
Princesses send their insect lovers in search
of fire.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the heart of a forest of
pine-trees that lay in a
remote corner of the Land
of the Dragon-Fly, dwelt Chiyotaro, a
prosperous sparrow, who was honoured and
beloved alike by his family and friends. He
had many beautiful children, but not one
with manners more distinguished, or heart
more true, than Tschiotaro. He was the
life of the little household; merry as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
summer-day is long, and talkative as only a
sparrow can be.</p>

<p>Tschiotaro would fly afar through the
woods, and across the surrounding plains;
indeed, at times, he would even come within
sight of the towering peaks of the Matchless
Mountain. With the first whisper of
the approach of sundown, he would wing
his way homeward, to delight the loved
ones in the pine forest with the story
of his day&rsquo;s adventures. Laughter and
sounds of glee echoed through the twilight,
as the sparrow family listened to Tschiotaro&rsquo;s
chatter. Then came the hush of night,
and there was silence in the depths of the
wood.</p>

<p>One sunny morning Tschiotaro chirped his
farewell, and flew off he knew not whither.
At last, he alighted in the shadowy bamboo
grove where Kosuzumi, the tongue-cut
sparrow, dwelt. Truly the gods had
favoured him in guiding his flight to this
spot. Kosuzumi was beautiful, but her
daughter Osuzu was even more lovely. She
was blithe, warm-hearted, and winsome;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
simple, too, was the maiden whose days
had been spent in the cool shade of the
bamboo thicket. Tschiotaro had only to
see her to love her. At first, it is true, he
was a little shy, and hopped around the
beautiful one with mute appeal in his tiny
sparkling eyes; but when he saw that Osuzu
smiled and peeped coyly at him, he grew
bolder, and even ventured to address her.
Little by little the talk became more animated:
reserve vanished, and mutual confidences
passed. Tschiotaro and Osuzu had,
in truth, entered the Garden of Bliss, which
is known in the feathered world of Japan
as <i>Okugi</i>. Time sped apace, and the hour
of parting came all too quickly. Tschiotaro
assured Osuzu that he would soon return.
As he travelled through the summer air,
laden with the fragrance of myriad flowers,
a deep joy filled his heart and added zest
to his flight. Osuzu, happy in her new-found
love, was rocked peacefully to sleep
by the swaying of the bamboo branches in
the soft breeze.</p>

<p>Tschiotaro lost no time in making known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
to his father his love for the beautiful
daughter of Kosuzumi, and declared that
she, and none other, should be his bride.
The old one heard the news with surprise.
Rich and respected as he was, he
could not permit his son to marry the first
maiden with whom he fell in love; but
as Chiyotaro sat contentedly in a quiet
nook of his rustling home, his love for
his son, and the desire to see him happy,
outweighed all other considerations. He
said, &ldquo;If Osuzu be good and true, I will
not refuse to give my consent.&rdquo; Even before
he heard that Osuzu belonged to a
family honoured far and wide, that her home
was dainty, and that her mother was the
famous tongue-cut sparrow, Chiyotaro had
determined that nothing should cloud his
son&rsquo;s happiness.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a day or two, Tschiotaro&rsquo;s
glowing story was confirmed by the
wise ones among the sparrows. Father and
mother were content, and, according to old
custom, an envoy was despatched to the
parents of Osuzu with a formal offer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
marriage. The family in the bamboo thicket,
after due deliberation, consented to meet
Chiyotaro. All went well. The wedding
day was speedily fixed, and all manner of
preparations were made for the auspicious
event.</p>

<p>The home that was to shelter Tschiotaro
and Osuzu was built with the greatest care
in the upper branches of a beautiful cherry
tree, whose pure white petals in blossom-time
would lend fragrance and peace to the happy
retreat. Many were the gifts which arrived
to adorn, and add comfort to, the new abode.
Sparrows from far and near vied with one
another in the delicacy and variety of their
offerings, until the dwelling was wondrously
enticing.</p>

<p>Just before the wedding day, Osuzu rejoiced
at the arrival of rare gifts from her
beloved Tschiotaro. An <i>obi</i> of dewdrops,
which held in them the secrets of the sun;
a head-dress, fashioned of the slender petals
of a mountain flower; and tiny moss sandals,
so soft and exquisite that she donned
them at once for very love and pride;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
these and many other gifts did Tschiotaro
bestow. Nor were Osuzu&rsquo;s parents unmindful
of their duties. A grand robe of
ceremony, woven of the pinky blossom of the
peach, as well as <i>sak&eacute;</i> and luscious fruit, were
sent to Tschiotaro.</p>

<p>The morning of the marriage dawned. By
the time the sun touched with glory the peak
of Fusi-yama, the sparrow families were busy
preparing for the day&rsquo;s festivities. Long ere
the purple shadows had lifted from the valleys,
the wedding procession had assembled
from copse, and hedgerow, and woodland.
Never before had such a concourse of
sparrows been seen. Tschiotaro was widely
beloved, and the beauty of Osuzu had become
noised abroad.</p>

<p>On arrival at their new home, the bride and
bridegroom sipped thrice of the three cups of
rice wine which consecrated their union, and
afterwards the whole company drank freely
to the health and well-being of the newly
wedded pair. Sounds of revelry and rejoicing
lasted until the late evening; and long after
the sun had bade his daily farewell to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
cherry grove the sparrows still chattered and
twittered.</p>

<p>As the moon, with her attendant maidens,
rose slowly in the heavens, the festal sounds
died away and silence reigned.</p>

<p>Tschiotaro and Osuzu spent many happy
years of wedded sparrowhood. They had
children fair and graceful as themselves, and
never had cause to regret their loving
union.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N Idzumo, the Province
of the Gods,
are many foxes. There
the wicked Ninko, in
league with the <i>oni</i>,
prowls about at nightfall
and carries away
the souls of little children,
he robs the poor
man of his rice and
millet, and bewitches
the maidens who cross
his path. There, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
is his enemy the Inari fox, who is kind of
heart. The Inari loves the children, and
warns the anxious mothers when Ninko is
near; he guards the store of the peasant, and
comes to the aid of maidens in distress.</p>

<p>Many centuries ago, there lived a young
Inari fox. She was snow-white, and her eyes
were keen and intelligent. She was beloved
by all the good people for miles around. They
were glad if, in the evening, she knocked
softly with her tail against the window of their
hut; when she entered she would play with
the children, eat of their humble fare, and
then trot away. The god Inari protected
those who were kind to her. The Ninko
foxes hated her.</p>

<p>There were hunters in the country of Idzumo
who thirsted for the blood of the beautiful
white fox. Once or twice she nearly lost her
life at the hands of these cruel men.</p>

<p>One summer afternoon, she was frisking
about in the woods with some young fox
friends, when two men caught sight of her.
They were fleet of foot and had dogs by their
side. Off ran the white fox. The men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
uttered an excited cry and gave chase. Instead
of going towards the open plain, she
made for the Temple of Inari Daim-yojin.
&ldquo;There surely I will find a safe refuge from
my pursuers,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>Now Yaschima, a young prince of the noble
house of Abe, was in the temple, deep in
meditation. The white fox, whose strength
was almost spent, ran fearlessly up to him
and took refuge beneath the thick folds of his
robe. Yaschima was moved with pity, and
did all in his power to soothe the poor
frightened creature. He said, &ldquo;I will protect
you, little one; you have nothing to fear.&rdquo;
The fox looked up at him, and seemed to
understand. She ceased to tremble. Then
the Prince went to the door of the great
temple. Two men hastened up to him and
asked if he had seen a pure white fox. &ldquo;It
must have run into the Temple of Inari. We
would have its blood to cure the sickness of
one of our family.&rdquo; But Yaschima, faithful
to his promise, answered: &ldquo;I have been in
the temple praying to the good god, but I
can tell you nothing of the fox.&rdquo; The men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
were about to leave him, when, behind his
robe, they spied a white bushy tail. Fiercely
they demanded that he should stand aside.
The Prince firmly refused. But, intent on
their prey, the men attacked him, and he was
obliged to draw his sword in self-defence. At
this moment Yaschima&rsquo;s father, a brave old
man, came up; he rushed upon the enemies of
his son, but a deadly blow, which Yaschima
could not avert, struck him down. Then the
young Prince was very wroth, and, with two
mighty strokes, he felled his adversaries to
the ground.</p>

<p>The loss of his beloved father filled Yaschima
with grief. He did not break out into loud
lamentation, for the sorrow lay too near his
heart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">

<p class="caption">With two mighty strokes, he felled his adversaries to the ground.</p>
</div>

<p>Then a sweet song fell on his ear. It came
from the temple. As he re-entered the sacred
building, a beautiful maiden stood before him.
She turned, and saw that he was in deep
trouble. The Prince told her of the snow-white
fox, and the cruel hunters, and the death of
his father whom he loved. The maiden spoke
tender words of sympathy; her voice was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"><!-- full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
soft and sweet that the sound brought comfort
to him. When Yaschima learned that
the maiden was true, that her heart was as
pure and beautiful as her face, he loved her,
and asked her to be his bride. She replied,
very gently, &ldquo;I already love you. I know
that you are good and brave, and I would
solace you for the loss of your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were wed. Yaschima did not forget
the death of his father, but he remembered
that his beautiful wife had then been given
to him. For some time they lived happily
together. The days passed swiftly. Yaschima
ruled his people wisely, and his fair Princess
was ever by his side. Each morning they
went to the temple, and thanked the good god
Inari for the joy that had come to them.</p>

<p>Now a son was born to the Prince and
Princess. They gave him the name of Seimei.
Thereafter the Princess became sorely troubled.
She sat alone for hours, and tears sprang to
her eyes when Yaschima asked her the cause
of her sorrow. One day she took his hand
and said, &ldquo;Our life here has been very beautiful.
I have given you a son to be with you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
always. The god Inari now tells me that I
must leave you. He will guard you as you
guarded me from the hunters at the door of
the great temple. I am none other than the
snow-white fox whose life you saved.&rdquo; Once
more she looked into his eyes, and then,
without a word, she was gone.</p>

<p>Yaschima and Seimei lived long in the
Province of the Gods. They were greatly
beloved, but the snow-white fox was seen no
more.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the Central Land
of Reed-Plains
dwelt two rats. Their
home was in a lonely
farmstead surrounded by rice fields. Here
they lived happily for so many years that
the other rats in the district, who had
constantly to change their quarters, believed
that their neighbours were under the special
protection of Fukoruku Jin, one of the Seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
Gods of Happiness, and the Patron of Long
Life.</p>

<p>These rats had a large family of children.
Every summer day they led the little ones into
the rice fields, where, under shelter of the
waving stalks, the young rats learned the
history and cunning of their people. When
work was done, they would scamper away and
play with their friends until it was time to
return home.</p>

<p>The most beautiful of these children was
Nedzumi, the pride of her parents&rsquo; heart. She
was truly a lovely little creature, with sleek
silvery skin, bright intelligent eyes, tiny upstanding
ears, and pearly white teeth. It
seemed to the fond father and mother that no
one was great enough to marry their daughter,
but, after much pondering, they decided that
the most powerful being in the whole universe
should be their son-in-law.</p>

<p>The parents discussed the weighty question
with a trusted neighbour, who said, &ldquo;If you
would wed your daughter to the most powerful
being in the universe, you must ask the sun to
marry her, for his empire knows no bounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
How they mounted through the skies, no
rat can tell. The sun gave them audience and
listened graciously as they said, &ldquo;We would
give you our daughter to wife.&rdquo; He smiled
and rejoined, &ldquo;Your daughter is indeed beautiful,
and I thank you for coming so far to offer
her to me. But, tell me, why have you chosen
me out of all the world?&rdquo; The rats made
answer, &ldquo;We would marry our Nedzumi to the
mightiest being, and you alone wield world-wide
sway.&rdquo; Then the sun replied, &ldquo;Truly
my kingdom is vast, but oftentimes, when I
would illumine the world, a cloud floats by
and covers me. I cannot pierce the cloud;
therefore you must go to him if your wish is
to be attained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In no way discouraged, the rats left the sun
and came to a cloud as he rested after a flight
through the air. The cloud received them
less cordially than the sun, and replied to their
offer, with a look of mischief in his dusky eyes,
&ldquo;You are mistaken if you think that I am the
most powerful being. It is true that I sometimes
hide the sun, but I cannot withstand the
force of the wind. When he begins to blow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
I am driven away, and torn in pieces. My
strength is not equal to the power of the
wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little saddened, the rats, intent on their
daughter&rsquo;s future prosperity, waylaid the wind
as he swept through a pine forest. He
was about to awaken the plain beyond, to
stir the grass and the flowers into motion.
The two anxious parents made known their
mission. This was the whispered reply of the
wind: &ldquo;It is true that I have strength to
drive away the clouds, but I am powerless
against the wall which men build to keep
me back. You must go to him if you would
have the mightiest being in the world for
your son-in-law. Indeed I am not so mighty
as the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rats, still persistent in their quest, came
to the wall and told their story. The wall
answered, &ldquo;True, I can withstand the wind,
but the rat undermines me and makes holes
through my very heart. To him you must go
if you would wed your daughter to the most
powerful being in the world. I cannot overcome
the rat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
And now the parent rats returned to their
home in the farmstead. Nedzumi, their beautiful
daughter with the silken coat and sparkling
eyes, rejoiced when she heard that she was to
marry one of her own people, for her heart
had already been given to a playfellow of the
rice fields. They were married, and lived for
many years as king and queen of the rat
world.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY moons ago, a teacher of music
lived not far from Ky&#333;to. A faithful
serving-woman and a beautiful cat were his
sole companions. Gon was a handsome fellow,
with sleek coat, bushy tail, and grass-green
eyes that glowed in the darkness. His master
loved him, and would say as the cat purred
by his side in the evening, &ldquo;Nothing shall
part us, old friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
O-Ume was a happy maiden whose home lay
in the midst of the plum groves. Her chief
pet was a little cat. Koma had very winning
ways; her mistress delighted to watch her.
She blinked so prettily, she ate so daintily, she
licked her rose-red nose so carefully with her
tiny tongue, that O-Ume would catch her up,
and say fondly, &ldquo;Koma, Koma, you are a
good cat. I am sure your ancestors shed
tears when our Lord Buddha died. You
shall never leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It happened that Gon and Koma met, and
fell deeply in love with one another. Gon was
so handsome that any of the cats in the district
would gladly have been his mate, but he
did not deign to notice one of them. When
he saw the little maid Koma, his heart beat
quickly.</p>

<p>The cats were in great distress, for neither
the music-master nor O-Ume would hear of
parting with their pet. Gon&rsquo;s master would
willingly have taken Koma to live with him,
but O-Ume would not hear of this; nor were
Koma&rsquo;s entreaties more successful.</p>

<p>It was the seventh night of the seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
moon, the night sacred to lovers in the Land
of Great Peace, when Kingen crosses the
Silver River of Heaven and Shakujo joyfully
embraces him. Gon and Koma left their
homes and fled together. It was a moonbright
night, and the cats were light of heart
as they scampered through the fields of rice
and across the great open plains. When day
broke, they were near a palace which stood in
a large park, full of stately old trees and ponds
covered with sweet lotus-blooms. Koma said,
&ldquo;If only we could live in that palace, how
glorious it would be!&rdquo; As she spoke, a fierce
dog caught sight of the cats, and bounded towards
them angrily. Koma gave a cry of
terror, and sprang up a cherry tree. Gon did
not stir. &ldquo;Dear Koma shall see that I am a
hero, and would rather lose my life than run
away.&rdquo; But the dog was powerful, and would
have killed Gon. He was almost upon the
brave cat, when a serving-man drove him off,
and carried Gon into the palace. Poor little
Koma was left alone to lament her loss.</p>

<p>The Princess who lived in the palace was
overjoyed when Gon was brought to her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
Many days passed before he was allowed out
of her sight. Then he hunted far and near for
his fair lover, but all in vain. &ldquo;My Koma is
lost to me for ever,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>

<p>Now the Princess lived in splendour and
happiness. She had but one trouble; a great
snake loved her. At all hours of the day and
night the animal would creep up and try to
come near her. A constant guard was kept,
but still the serpent, at times, succeeded in
gaining the door of her chamber. One afternoon,
the Princess was playing softly to herself
on the <i>koto</i>, when the snake crept unobserved
past the guards and entered her room. In a
moment, Gon sprang upon its neck and bit it
so furiously that the hideous creature soon lay
dead. The Princess heard the noise and
looked round. When she saw that Gon had
risked his life for her, she was deeply moved;
she stroked him and whispered kind words
into his ear. He was praised by the whole
household, and fed upon the daintiest morsels
in the palace. But there was a cloud upon his
happiness: the loss of Koma.</p>

<p>On a summer day he lay sunning himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
before the door of the palace. Half asleep,
he looked out upon the world and dreamed
of the moonlight night when he and Koma
escaped from their former homes. In the
park a big cat was ill-treating a little one, too
fragile to take care of herself. Gon jumped
up and flew to her aid. He soon drove the
cruel cat away; then he turned towards the
little one to ask if she were hurt. Koma, his
long-lost love, stood before him! Not the
sleek, beautiful Koma of other days, for she
was thin and sad, but her eyes sparkled when
she saw that Gon was her deliverer.</p>

<p>The two cats went to the Princess. They
told her the story of their love, their flight,
their separation, and their reunion. She entered
whole-heartedly into their new-found joy.</p>

<p>On the seventh night of the seventh moon
Gon and Koma were married. The Princess
watched over them, and they were happy.
Many years passed. One day she found them
curled up together. The two faithful hearts
had ceased to beat.</p>
